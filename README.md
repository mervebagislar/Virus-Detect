In this project, I developed an advanced web application using the Django framework. The project aimed to create a system that allows users to scan files, URLs, and IP addresses for security analysis. First, I built a VirusTotal-like system to analyze uploaded files, entered URLs, and queried IP addresses. For IP scanning, I added mapping and listing features to visually display the connection location on a map. Additionally, I provided users with "clean" or "infected" outputs from antivirus engines, offering detailed security insights for each file, URL, and IP address.

I used machine learning to detect whether emails were spam. By integrating the spam detection model into the system, I enabled users to analyze the security of their emails. To enhance security in the admin panel, I implemented two-factor authentication (2FA). I integrated Google Authenticator via QR codes, adding an extra security layer for admin logins.

I designed pages where users can register, log in, and create profiles. Additionally, I developed an interface for managing the admin panel, ensuring a user-friendly experience with login, registration, and profile creation pages. Overall, the project introduced significant improvements in security, user experience, and functionality, maximizing users' online safety.
