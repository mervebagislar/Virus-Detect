As HSD Software Team, we developed a dynamic and mobile-friendly website for HSD BandÄ±rma. We designed the entire UI from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, managing version control with Git. Features include an admin panel for managing club members, "About Us" and "Vision-Mission" cards, social media and Medium links, a contact form, and email integration. The slider dynamically displays the latest five announcements from the admin panel. We also implemented a certificate verification system where certificate IDs are managed via the panel, showing results with user details. With SEO optimization, the project ensures both web and mobile compatibility.
